<h1> A Grinch View on Valentine's Day with You </h1>
<p> You were only my pick
   because the rest of the men were sick.
    I wouldn't have looked so sour
    if you had brought me flowers.
    Good luck in the future with the ladies,
    maybe if you don't mumble you'll have some success on Bumble.
